<h3>Music</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    A great passion I grow from the age of 14 years is the passion for music, playing the trumpet. I have started the
    my studies within the course of music of Anzio "town band" then I had perfected myself as self teacher.
    My favorite genres are in Rhythm & Blues, funky, jazz and of course classical music with special trend
    for opera. During the years I moved from a more classical sound to a more bright sound and a more attention
    to high notes, in all my groups soon I become the lead trumpet player.
