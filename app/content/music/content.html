    I have started to learn music since to 12 years old in the Banda Comunale "Citta di Anzio".
    After more and the less 2 years I have started to play the trumpet since to 14 years old, it was a lightning strike
    in very few months I developed all the classical registry starting from the low F# to the high C and over, until double G with a classical 3C Bach mouthpiece.
    When I was 19 years old, I had started to play as lead trumpet player in R&B, Disco, Jazz ensemble and so on.
    In any ensemble in with I played the my sound was unmistakable powerful, bright and many high notes,
    some times even over hing C near to double G and over.
