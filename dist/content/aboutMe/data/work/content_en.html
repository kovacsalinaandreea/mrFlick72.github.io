    Starting from 2012 I started to work on Geo-Consulting, work experience that I do paralleling university.
    In my "business trip" started in Geo-consulting I I could hone my knowledge of Java,
    aexpanding my horizons to the classic Java EE stack, Spring Framework and its ecosystem in which it currently can boast of working experience and not from 2013.<br/>
    Staring from november of 2015 I had started to work in Sourcesense, company in which I'm having the opportunity of
    learn more about of the most important open source  project/product like <a href="https://spring.io/" target="_blank">Spring</a>
