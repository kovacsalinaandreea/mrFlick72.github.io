    Since the age of 8 years, I have been in contact with Computers. the passion was transmitted by my uncle Cruciano Felice,
    person to whom I owe so much and to which they are affectionate, it was he that I present my first computer, a Sony with a built-in MSX BASIC.
    The computer being used and quite old it wasn't attractive as gaming machine and the only inviting job was programming.
    In this way I started programming in Basic, starting from my 8 years. After the hig school I entred in the faculty of computer engineering.
